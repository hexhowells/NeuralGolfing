# Neural Golfing
**Neural Golfing:** Generalising functions with the fewest number of neural network parameters

## Goal
Get at least 98% accuracy on the MNIST test set using a model with the fewest number of training parameters

## Rules
- Can only train the model on the MNIST training set
- Can use image transformations but input image size should remain the same (28x28)
- Model result must be replicatable
- Entire training process should be automated

## Results
| Number of parameters | highest accuracy |
| -------------------- | ---------------- |
| 1055                 | 98.01%           |
